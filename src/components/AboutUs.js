      Rocketship Productions was founded by writer /director Nick Wild and
      casting director Nicci Topping shortly after the devastating Giggle Famine
      in 1746. They vowed to never let this happen again - not on their watch,
      no sirree bob!

      We focus on comedy for digital, film and TV, working with some of the best
      established stars and new talent in UK comedy, and we live in hope that
      people chuckle along with what we produce.
